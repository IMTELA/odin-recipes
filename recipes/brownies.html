        <h1>Best Brownies Ever</h1>
        <img src="https://img.buzzfeed.com/thumbnailer-prod-us-east-1/video-api/assets/166813.jpg" alt="Best ever brownies" height="350" width="400">
        <p><em>These amazing homemade brownies boast the same <strong>chewiness</strong> as boxed ones but deliver an extra punch of <strong>intense chocolatey goodness</strong>. Because these brownies are made with both melted high-quality chocolate and cocoa powder, they have a well-rounded chocolate taste with an extra depth of flavor that makes them <strong>irresistible</strong>.</em></p><p><strong>Remember to remove the brownies from the oven when a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with moist, fudgy crumbs; any longer, the brownies will turn out dry. For the final touch, sprinkle with sea salt for that irresistible sweet-savory contrast. After cooling, slice into squares for a treat bound to vanish in no time!</strong></p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 ½ sticks unsalted butter, plus more, softened, for greasing</li>
            <li>8 oz good-quality semisweet chocolate (225 g), or bittersweet chocolate, 60-70% cacao, roughly chopped</li>
            <li>¾ cup unsweetened dutch process cocoa powder (90 g), divided</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon espresso powder</li>
            <li>2 cups granulated sugar (400 g)</li>
            <li>½ cup dark brown sugar (110 g), packed</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
            <li>6 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour (125 g)</li>
            <li>flaky sea salt, for sprinkling</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Grease a 9x13-inch (23x33-cm) dark metal pan with softened butter, then line with parchment paper, leaving overhang on all sides. Grease the parchment with softened butter.</li>
            <li>Combine the chopped chocolate, ¼ cup (30 g) of cocoa powder, and espresso powder in a heatproof liquid measuring cup or medium bowl and set aside.</li>
            <li>Add the butter to a small saucepan over medium heat and cook until the butter just comes to a vigorous simmer, about 5 minutes, swirling the pan occasionally. Immediately pour the hot butter over the chocolate mixture and let sit for 2 minutes. Whisk until the chocolate is completely smooth and melted, then set aside.</li>
            <li>Combine the granulated sugar, brown sugar, vanilla extract, salt, and eggs in a large bowl. Beat with an electric hand mixer on high speed until light and fluffy, about 10 minutes. It will be similar to the texture of very thick pancake batter.</li>
            <li>With the mixer on, pour in the slightly cooled chocolate and butter mixture and blend until smooth.</li>
            <li>Position a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 350°F (180°C).</li>
            <li>Sift in the flour and remaining cocoa powder and use a rubber spatula to gently fold until just combined.</li>
            <li>Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake until lightly puffed on top, about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove the baking pan from the oven using oven mitts or kitchen towels, then lightly drop the pan on a flat surface 1-2 times until the brownies deflate slightly. Sprinkle with flaky sea salt.</li>
            <li>Return the pan to the oven and bake until a wooden skewer inserted into the center of the brownies comes out fudgy but the edges look cooked through, about 20 minutes more. The center of the brownies will seem under-baked, but the brownies will continue to set as they cool.</li>
            <li>Set the brownies on a cooling rack and cool completely in the pan.</li>
            <li>Use the parchment paper to lift the cooled brownies out of the pan. Cut into 24 bars and serve immediately.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
