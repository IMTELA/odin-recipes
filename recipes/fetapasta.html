        <p><em>With roasted tomatoes and sharp, tangy feta, this baked pasta dish is undeniably delicious. But the real beauty of this dish is its simplicity and versatility. It couldn't be easier to make—the recipe itself is practically hands-off. Plus, you can really use the classic recipe as a jumping-off point (like we did here) to make your ideal pasta dinner.</em></p>
